### Description
Welcome to my Week 3 Skill Distillery Project, Jets!
This Program will list 5 jets that I put into from a text file, allow you to make your own jet, add it to the list of available jets. Display all their info, tell you how long they can fly. A couple custom phrases when you "fight" or "load" their cargo!

### Lessons Learned
ArrayList are significantly easier to use with multiple ways to utilize them. Arrays have their place but I believe ArrayList are superior. Please see below article for more information.<br>
